# Capstone: Restaurant Reservation System

Full Stack Application built using Javascript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js and PostgresQL that allows users to make reservations for their restaurant. A user can create a new reservation for a party, create tables that exist within their restaurant, and can seat reservations at tables in order to keep track of which tables are occupied by a reservation. The user also has the ability to edit reservations, search for any reservation by phone number, and clear tables once a reservation is finished.
